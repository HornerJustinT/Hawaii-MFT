## Description 

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

The Hawaiian Islands Association for Marriage and Family Therapy needed an easy way to track their members and highlight therapist members to the public and potential clients. HIAMFT is currently managing its members using spreedsheets, making data management inefficient and time-consuming. Additionally, HIAMFT lacks an easy way for members to get in touch with each other, and for potential clients to find member therapists' contact information, thereby limiting mental healthcare access for those who may need it in the Hawaiian Islands. 

The Hawaiian Islands Marriage and Family Therapy Directory is a web-based application developed to assist HIAMFT in its mission of promoting the common professional interest of marriage and family therapists, as well as in supporting its members and educating the public. It enables member therapists to create a profile, edit their profile information, send referral emails to their clients, allow users to search and connect with a therapist locally and enable the adminstrators to manage their member data with advanced searches for data sorting and .csv downloads of those data sorting results. 

The aim of this web-based directory is to help HIAMFT members reach more clients, organize themselves better and promote their common professional interests. In doing so, the Hawaiian Islands Marriage and Family Therapy Directory will help increase mental health accesibility on the islands of Hawaii and help HIAMFT members become more successful in their profession.
